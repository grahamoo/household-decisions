This GitHub repository creates the tables and graphs used in my writing sample for PhD applications. To reproduce the tables and graphs on your own device, see the instructions below for downloading data and customizing do-files.


**Data:**

DHS: I do not have the rights to publicly share the 2015-2016 NFHS-4 India DHS survey data, but it can be requested from the DHS website at the following link: https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/India_Standard-DHS_2015.cfm?flag=0
The women's survey data is under "Individual Recode" and the men's survey data is under "Men's recode". The downloaded women's data should be [saved here](https://github.com/grahamoo/household-decisions/tree/main/Data/Raw/DHS/Womens%20DHS) and the downloaded men's data should be [saved here](https://github.com/grahamoo/household-decisions/tree/main/Data/Raw/DHS/Mens%20DHS).
	
ECI election data: 

2011 Census of India: The Census data used in this paper is downloaded from the following link and is under the title "PCA-TOT: Primary Census Abstract Total": https://censusindia.gov.in/census.website/data/census-tables

**Do-files:** 

The full pipeline of do-files can be run from _master.do_. The globals of directories at the top of _master.do_ need to be customized to the paths of the do-files and data on your personal device.
